# DATA-VALIDATION-PROJECT

# Data Validation Project

This project focuses on data validation, which involves checking and ensuring the accuracy, integrity, and quality of data. The project provides tools and methodologies to validate data, identify inconsistencies, and ensure data meets predefined criteria.

## Features

- Data Validation Framework: The project includes a robust data validation framework that allows users to define validation rules and apply them to different datasets.

- Rule Engine: The rule engine provides a flexible and extensible way to define validation rules using a combination of pre-built validators and custom rules.

- Pre-built Validators: The project includes a set of pre-built validators to handle common data validation scenarios, such as data type validation, range validation, format validation, and more.

- Custom Rules: Users can easily define custom rules specific to their data validation requirements. The project provides guidelines and examples to create custom rules.

- Data Profiling: The project includes data profiling capabilities to analyze and understand the characteristics and quality of the data. It helps in identifying patterns, anomalies, and potential issues in the dataset.

- Reporting: The project generates detailed reports summarizing the validation results, including a comprehensive overview of the data quality, validation errors, and statistical metrics.
